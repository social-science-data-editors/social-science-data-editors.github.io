We have a (low-intensity) mailing list for data and reproducibility editors, and a more active working group that meets monthly, and maintains these resources. We use a mailing list for discussion.

- to join general list, send email to [socsci-data-editors-l-request@cornell.edu](mailto:socsci-data-editors-l-request@cornell.edu?subject=join) with subject line "join". Approval required. You might contact any one of the working group members prior to sending the email.
- to join the active working group, contact [Lars Vilhuber](mailto:lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu). Meetings are usually first Monday of the month, 11:00AM Eastern/17:00 Central European time.
